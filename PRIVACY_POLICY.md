## Scrim Creator

This is a simple application for Android that generates random matches made up of random teams and on random maps!
This app is available on Google Play.

Scrim Creator works by the user creating a list of players and as an option they can also create a list of games that include maps. When generating a game the user chooses the number of games they would like the play, the size of the teams and whether or not they want random maps generated with the matches.

As a developer I take privacy very seriously, with it always in mind when I am creating an app. That being said Scrim Creator does NOT collect any personal user data. All user-entered data (player, game and map lists) are stored on the device and can be deleted in the in-app settings tab or by uninstalling the app itself.

If you notice any vulnerability within the app or have any questions regarding the code and how the app functions, please don't hesitate to email me and I will get back to you ASAP.
